#CodeBook

This codebook describes the resulting two data sets that run_analysis.R produce

(further information about the data gathered can be found in "features_info.txt" file included in the raw data files)

###First Data Set (as listed in R as "combined"):

Contains 67 variables:

1 - "Activity "- noted as being one of the following 6 values 
	(1) WALKING
	(2) WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	(3) WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	(4) SITTING
	(5) STANDING
	(6) LAYING

2-67 - Data related to mean and standard deviations of the trial and test data:
	
	tBodyAcc-mean()-X
	tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
	tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
	tBodyAcc-std()-X
	tBodyAcc-std()-Y
	tBodyAcc-std()-Z

	tGravityAcc-mean()-Z
	tGravityAcc-std()-X
	tGravityAcc-std()-Y
	tGravityAcc-std()-Z
	tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X

	tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z
	tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X
	tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y
	tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z
	tBodyAccMag-mean()
	tBodyAccMag-std()
	tGravityAccMag-mean()
	tGravityAccMag-std()
	tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()
	tBodyAccJerkMag-std()
	tBodyGyroMag-mean()
	tBodyGyroMag-std()
	tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()
	tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()
	fBodyAcc-mean()-X
	fBodyAcc-mean()-Y
	fBodyAcc-mean()-Z
	fBodyAcc-std()-X
	fBodyAcc-std()-Y
	fBodyAcc-std()-Z
	fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X
	fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y
	fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z
	fBodyAccJerk-std()-X
	fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y
	fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z
	fBodyGyro-mean()-X
	fBodyGyro-mean()-Y
	fBodyGyro-mean()-Z
	fBodyGyro-std()-X
	fBodyGyro-std()-Y
	fBodyGyro-std()-Z
	fBodyAccMag-mean()
	fBodyAccMag-std()
	fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()
	fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()
	fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()
	fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()
	fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()
	fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()


####To achieve the resultant dataset:
1) All training and test data were merged to one data set,
2) The measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement were then extracted, and
3) Descriptive names were given to the activities performed and to each variable.


###Second Data Set (as listed in R as "tidy" and saved in table "UCI_tidy.csv"):

Contains 68 variables:


1 - "Activity "- noted as being one of the following 6 values 
	(1) WALKING
	(2) WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	(3) WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	(4) SITTING
	(5) STANDING
	(6) LAYING

2 - "Subject" - The person to whom the measurements apply

3-68 - Data related to mean and standard deviations of the trial and test data

####To achieve the resultant "tidy" dataset:
The data in the first data set was averaged over each variable for each activity and each subject
